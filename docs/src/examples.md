# Examples

A set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the current functionality of the package
is available in the [examples](https://github.com/juliohm/GeoStats.jl/tree/master/examples)
folder. These notebooks are distributed with GeoStats.jl and can be run locally with
`GeoStats.examples()`.

We are always happy to include new use cases. Please check [Contributing](contributing.md)
