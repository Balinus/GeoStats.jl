# Examples

A set of examples in the form of Jupyter notebook is made available
in the [examples](https://github.com/juliohm/GeoStats.jl/tree/master/examples)
folder of the project. They are distributed with GeoStats.jl and can
be run locally for full interactivity.

We are always happy to include new use cases. Please check
